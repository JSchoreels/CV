Current Software Engineer in Java environments, specializing in service-oriented architecture. It allowed me to quickly learn numerous technologies in web services communication and technical architecture.  I'm passionate about Open Source and communities that promote it like Linux and Apache Software Foundation. I love to share knowledge, since I believe that sharing knowledge, more than teaching a student, makes the teacher even better by restructuring, optimizing its own understanding.
