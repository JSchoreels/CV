\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I'm a passionate software engineer striving to constantly learn new skills and perfect the existing ones. Since I was a child, my curious mind pushed me towards Sciences and especially towards Physics and Mathematics, but it's with Computer Sciences that I finally fell in love when I had to choose my classes at the University of Mons. Even since the end of my Master Degree, I'm still continuing to read computer sciences books related to architecture, design \& innovative technologies. Combining passion and work is one of the various things that makes me enthusiastic, days after days. 

\paragraph{}
I'm specializing myself in Java technologies mostly due to its Open Source community and frameworks, which is a very important subject for me, as I'm curious to know how things work. I also have an affection for Functional Programming and Lambda calculus, that I've discovered with OCaml and that is more and more popular in JVM languages with Java 8 or Scala. I discovered Scala in Martin Odersky's class ``Functional Programming Principles in Scala'' on Coursera. 

\lettersection{Why N-SIDE?}
As a Computer Scientist, I sometimes feel that I don't use all the knowledge I learned in usual IT opportunities. For example, my skills and my love for Mathematics aren't often used for those. When I saw the different job descriptions available on your website, it instantly triggered my interest. I've applied here to the Software Solution Developer, but I'm confident that I can use more than my software engineering knowledge in the benefits of N-SIDE, such as Graphs and Networks, Computer Vision, Data-Mining \& Combinatorial Optimization. In conclusion, I have a strong belief that working together would be mutually beneficial.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I'm often described as someone passionate, and I like to describe it as an inner fire that always pushes me further. I'm however aware that passion must be canalized to not backfire, so I take time to cautiously and methodically think about what to learn and how to prioritize my goals. I'm also a quick learner, autodidact and when I acquire knowledge I love to share it in my turn. That would make me a strong asset for N-SIDE since I could ``soak up'' lot of your experts' knowledge and then redistribute it afterward. In conclusion, I would say my confidence isn't about believing to know everything but about being able to learn anything.
